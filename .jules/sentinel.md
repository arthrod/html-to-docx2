## 2024-05-15 - SSRF Vulnerability via Fetch

**Vulnerability:** The application uses `fetch()` directly on user-provided URLs in `src/utils/image.ts`, `src/utils/image-to-base64.ts`, and `src/utils/image-browser.ts` without validating the URL protocol. This allows `file://` protocols, leading to Local File Inclusion (LFI).
**Learning:** Naively passing strings to `fetch()` without a URL parse check enables unintended protocol resolution.
**Prevention:** Always parse URLs and assert an explicit allowlist (like `http:`, `https:`, `data:`, `blob:`) before invoking fetch. In this codebase, to support relative URLs without breaking them, use `try...catch` block that parses with a dummy base URL fallback. Ensure the generic `new Error(Invalid URL)` is thrown on failure so existing caching tests do not break.

## 2024-05-31 - SVG URL Protocol Bypass via url() Notation

**Vulnerability:** The SVG sanitizer (`hasDangerousProtocol`) failed to extract and inspect protocols inside `url(...)` CSS functions, which are valid in attributes like `style`, `fill`, `filter`, etc. This allowed attackers to bypass checks using payloads like `style="background: url(javascript:alert(1))"`.
**Learning:** String prefix checks (`startsWith`, `test`) on the entire attribute value are insufficient because functional notations nest the actual target URI. Attackers can conceal dangerous protocols deeper within the string.
**Prevention:** Always extract embedded URIs using regex (e.g. `/url\(\s*(['"]?)(.*?)\1\s*\)/g`) and apply protocol validation logic strictly to the extracted inner URI, rather than the raw outer string. Also ensure a robust safe data URI regex (`/^\s*data:image\/(png|jpeg|gif|webp|bmp);base64,/i`) is explicitly enforced.

## 2025-05-16 - SSRF Vulnerability Via Private IP Access

**Vulnerability:** Even when URL protocols were restricted to HTTP/HTTPS, image fetching functions did not validate the destination hostname. This allowed Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) against internal resources (e.g. `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `169.254.169.254`), including bypassed IP formats (like octal/hex).
**Learning:** Checking for safe URL schemes isn't enough; the destination host itself must be verified to prevent SSRF against loopback addresses and private networks.
**Prevention:** Implement an IP/hostname validator (like `isPrivateOrLocalHost`) before sending outbound requests to block known local and private IP ranges.

## 2026-07-18 - SSRF Vulnerability Via Trailing Dot Hostname Bypass

**Vulnerability:** The `isPrivateOrLocalHost` function in `src/utils/url.ts` did not strip trailing dots from hostnames before matching against private IP string constants (like `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`). This allowed attackers to bypass the SSRF protection by appending a dot (e.g. `127.0.0.1.` or `localhost.`), which Node.js still correctly resolves to the target internal host but avoids the exact string match checks.
**Learning:** Checking for safe URL schemes and performing exact string matches on private hostnames is insufficient because trailing dots in hostnames act as valid Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) for resolution but easily bypass strict string comparison filters.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize the hostname by lowercasing it and explicitly stripping trailing dots (e.g., `hostname.toLowerCase().replace(/\.$/, '')`) before applying any validation logic or private/local IP checks.
